\title{Perform randomization and measure network properties for a subnetwork.}
\usage{
run_randomization(
  graph,
  nodes_of_interest,
  num_randomizations = 1000,
  seed = 42
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the full network.}

\item{nodes_of_interest}{A vector of node names representing the subnetwork of interest.}

\item{num_randomizations}{Integer, the number of random subgraphs to generate (default is 1000).}

\item{seed}{Integer, the random seed for reproducibility (default is 42).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{observed_metrics}: A data frame with the observed network metrics for the subnetwork, including \code{lcc_size}, \code{avg_degree}, \code{clustering_coeff}, and \code{edge_density}.
\item \code{random_lcc_sizes}: A numeric vector of LCC sizes from the random subgraphs.
\item \code{random_degrees}: A numeric vector of average degrees from the random subgraphs.
\item \code{random_clustering_coeffs}: A numeric vector of clustering coefficients from the random subgraphs.
\item \code{random_edge_densities}: A numeric vector of edge densities from the random subgraphs.
}
}
\description{
This function computes various network metrics (largest connected component size, average degree, clustering coefficient, and edge density) for a subnetwork formed by nodes of interest from the input graph.
It also performs randomizations by sampling subgraphs of the same size from the network and computes the same metrics for these random subgraphs.
The function returns both the observed metrics for the subnetwork and distributions of metrics from the randomizations.
