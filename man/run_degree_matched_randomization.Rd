\usage{
run_degree_matched_randomization(
  graph,
  nodes_of_interest,
  num_randomizations = 1000,
  seed = 42
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the full network.}

\item{nodes_of_interest}{A character vector of node names representing the subnetwork of interest.}

\item{num_randomizations}{Integer, the number of randomizations to perform (default is 1000).}

\item{seed}{Integer, the random seed for reproducibility (default is 42).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{random_metrics}: A list of randomization metrics, including \code{lcc_sizes}, \code{avg_degrees}, \code{edge_densities}, and \code{clustering_coeffs}.
\item \code{observed_metrics}: A list of observed metrics for the original subnetwork, including \code{lcc_size}, \code{avg_degree}, \code{edge_density}, and \code{clustering_coeff}.
}
}
\description{
This function performs degree-matched randomization on the input graph by sampling subgraphs that match the degree distribution of a set of nodes of interest.
For each randomization, network metrics (largest connected component size, average degree, edge density, and global clustering coefficient) are calculated.
The function returns both the metrics for the observed subgraph and the distributions of metrics from the randomized subgraphs.
